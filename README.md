## ☕ Java | Forgework

Proven for nearly 30 years as the backbone of robust & concurrent with a vast ecosystem and extreme optimizations.

### **⛔ Avoided**
- **PHP** : no native concurrency
- **Go** : over-minimalist & boilerplate-heavy
- **Rust** : painful syntax, high cognitive load
- **Python**: slow at raw performance, duck typing overhead
- **Swift** : weak ecosystem, niche adoption
