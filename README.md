build scalable, performant, core-systems capable and built for precision engineering thats is proven by design where strong OOP & syntax, native concurrency, enterprise & metal-access and extreme optimizations.

# 🏯 Codedhims Stack
- Core : C# | NodeJS
- Datasource: Postgres, Redis
- Additionals : Java, Laravel, Go

# 🏗️ Primary Backbone
- Backend : AdonisJS
- Runtimes : Node, Bun
- Infra : PM2, RabbitMQ, Nginx
- JobQueue : BullMQ, Event Emitter
- Optimize : Cluster, TinyPool, FFI

Can It Quietly Outperform? 🔥
- JIT adapts over time for stable, long-running performance.
- AOT via NativeAOT & GraalVM gives fast, lightweight runtimes.
- Tunable GC/runtime: trimmed, throttled, and latency-aware.
- Concurrency & multithreading handled precisely under load.

Can It Build the Backbone? 🏯
- Proven in system-critical: banking, defense, telecom, healthcare, and embedded.
- Low-level access via unsafe, stackalloc, VarHandle, FFI.
- OOP handles complexity with clarity, modularity, and robustness.
- Battle-tested in enterprise, microservices, CLI, and backends.

# Antithesis
- Rust/Zig : Too low-level & horible
- Kotlin/Swift: Logic drift & UI-Oriented
- Python: Duck typing & weak perfor.
